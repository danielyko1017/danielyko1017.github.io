			<p style="text-align:center;font-size:50%;">Here is my first Scratch Project. It's meant to be a platformer with multiple stages and fluid animations between actions. Although there isn't much actual content, a lot of the work went into the animations, hitboxes, and lives system. The red box instantly kills you and causes a game over. Touching the enemy will remove one life out of three lives. When the lives reaches zero, then the game will end but if you reach the end of the second screen, you win!</p>

			<p style="text-align:center;font-size:50%;">Here is the MIT app inventor code for Pong. This code is an example of "block code" where you use blocks that have functions/variables to make a program. In order to do multiple things at once, you attach blocks together or put them inside another block. MIT App Inventor is a program that uses block code and allows users to make their own Android applications with it. </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:50%;">Here is what it looks like on the tablet. When we exported the block code above to our Android device, this is what our device showed us. The game is "Pong" but it's a one-player game instead. The main objective of Pong is to hit the ball back and forth with the block and make sure that it doesn't reach the other side. In our game, the block is meant to protect the ball from reaching the bottom and the ball repeatedly bounces off of the top.</p>

	<p style="text-align:center;font-size:50%;">Here is the python text-based game I made with repl.it. The game is meant to be an interactive fictional storyline in which the player can make decisions that affect the outcome of the story. There are only two real endings of the story so anything that says "Bad Ending" mean that the user has not reached the end of the story. There is error-catching in this game so that only the given answers will progress the game properly. This was done using Python 2.7 instead of Python 3 due to the differences in how they are coded and the syntax involved.</p>

	<p style="text-align:center;font-size:50%;">Here is the NetLogo simulation that I edited using NetLogo web. I started with the HIV simulation template that was given on the website. Since a lot of the main functions of the simulation were important to maintain, I only changed certain aspects of the simulation that don't affect how it runs heavily. For example, I changed the "not infected" color from green to yellow, "infected but doesn't know" from red to orange, and "infected but knows" from blue to violet. I also changed the turtle procedure from repeating 40 times to 100 times. I also changed the patch color from gray to yellow to make it distinct. Other than those changes, the simulation should work the exact same way as the original.</p>
