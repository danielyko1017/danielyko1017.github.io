			<p>Here is my first Scratch Project. It's meant to be a platformer with multiple stages and fluid animations between actions. Although there isn't much actual content, a lot of the work went into the animations, hitboxes, and lives system. The red box instantly kills you and causes a game over. Touching the enemy will remove one life out of three lives. When the lives reaches zero, then the game will end but if you reach the end of the second screen, you win!</p>

			<p style="text-align:center;font-size:100%;">Here is the MIT app inventor code for Pong. This code is an example of "block code" where you use blocks that have functions/variables to make a program. In order to do multiple things at once, you attach blocks together or put them inside another block. MIT App Inventor is a program that uses block code and allows users to make their own Android applications with it. </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:100%;">Here is what it looks like on the tablet. When we exported the block code above to our Android device, this is what our device showed us. The game is "Pong" but it's a one-player game instead. The main objective of Pong is to hit the ball back and forth with the block and make sure that it doesn't reach the other side. In our game, the block is meant to protect the ball from reaching the bottom and the ball repeatedly bounces off of the top.</p>
